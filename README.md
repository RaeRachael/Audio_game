# Audio_game

The aim is to a make a web based game in which the player is only given audio information (no visuals)

## Progress

### Level Generation
* Looks all good

### Audio
* Playable
* sounds being used could be changed
* possibly have options to customise the audio/echoes more on start screen

### Visual
* Ugly but functional

## Design

### Level Design
* self generating
* relative direction (left/right/forward) prioritised over absolute direction 

### Audio Design
* two steps per movement, hear the step and echos off the walls.
* steps would be baised to different ears.
* echos created by left, right and forward wall distance - volume, pitch and delay
* exit tile has a different pitch response

need to make a split for each step, split for echo, and then split for left, right and forward echoes?? 

### Visual Design
#### Start Screen
* shows " " to play (maybe pause)
* number of levels to play in the game - option
* how open or closed the level is - room to corridor idea - option
